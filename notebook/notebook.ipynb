       "'Viv, I know there are only three shopping days left, but they called, And they want to see your house in an hour. (rock music playing) Uh-huh. Mom! Make Buzz turn off the music. (pop music playing) No problem. Mom! - \"Mom.\" - Hang on, Viv. Let your sister rehearse. Like thatll help. And clean up the kitchen.  But... Now. Okay, Viv. Ill see you in a bit. I thought I told you to clean up the kitchen. I did. Can I go to the movies tonight with some friends? No. No... No, no. Im showing a house and I need you to baby-sit Kevin. Well, why cant Megan do it? Because she has to go to rehearsal at the teen center. And you dont  have  to go to the movies. I do if I want a life. Youre baby-sitting Kevin. Hey, where is he, anyway? Kevin. What is it? What is it?  BOY:  A car! Whoa!  MAN:  Wait a second. That was... Honey, that was mine. BUZZ (on tv):  Awesome. Its got an antenna and everything. DAD:  Merry Christmas, Mommy.  BOY:  Merry Christmas. MOM (on tv):  Merry Christmas. DAD:  What did I get?  BUZZ:  What is this? Megan:  Thank you.  MOM:  Everybody get in the shot. Everybody get together.  BUZZ:  Okay. MOM (on tv):  All right. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Very funny, Buzz. (Mom laughing on TV) - Last Christmas, huh? - Yeah. This Christmas isnt gonna be any fun. Of course it will. Honey, were gonna do all the same things weve always done. Sing Christmas carols, be with family and friends, Put cookies and milk out for Santa. - Its gonna be just the same. - Except this year, no Dad. Right. Thats the one thing thats different. Why cant you just get back together? (sighs) Honey, were just gonna have to let that go. (chattering on TV)  Thats a no, right? It means some things are just out of our control. I know you miss your dad. And he loves me very much. You both do, and it has nothing to do with me. - Did he tell you that? - Im nine years old. I watch a lot of tv. Did he leave because of me? No. Of course not. I knew it. It was Buzz and Megan. (chuckles) Oh, it wasnt anyone... Or any one thing. Then what was it? Thats not easy to explain. But, uh, sometimes when... people are married for a long time, they get into kind of a rut. You know what a rut is? Yeah. Like, when people arent having any fun, and theyre really bored. Kind of like that. Now, will you come downstairs? When youre ready. (chattering on TV) Hey! (clapping) Wait a second. Megan: Kevin, come in here. BUZZ: Yeah, hurry, youve gotta see this! (groans) Ow! Hey! Hey! - You always fall for that. - Let me up, zit-face! - Lamebrain. When are you gonna learn? - Get off your brother. - And shouldnt you be rehearsing? - (Kevin grunting) - How are you getting to the teen center? - Ashleys moms picking me up in a half hour. (grunting continues) Can I please go to the movies? No. I told you. Youre watching Kevin. - Please let him go. Ill stay home alone. - No. - (scoffs) Ive done it before. - Dont remind me. You loused up my whole night. If Im gonna be miserable, youre gonna be miserable. Mom! (door opens) MAN: Hello. Its me. Dad! Dad! Hey, big guy. (growls playfully) I didnt know you were coming tonight. Oh, I thought Id surprise you. Hey, Dad. Hey, Buzz. Oh, Kate. Gosh, the place looks great. Really nice decorations. - Same as every year. - KEVIN: So, um, Dad, whyd you come tonight? Actually, I want to talk to your mom about something. Privately. Do you think he wants to come home? Aw, Kev. (huffs) What? No \"Hello, how are ya?\" Im sorry. I have a business appointment, Peter. What do you want? Okay, gosh. I wasnt gonna jump right into it, but... Well, you know Natalie and I are living together, and, uh, well, when our divorce is final, Im gonna marry her. Really? Youre getting married again. Wow. Thats, uh... That... (exhales) Wow. Weve only been separated eight months. Yeah, I... it just happened real quickly, and... listen, Kate, I really want the kids to spend a little time with me over the holidays. You want the kids for Christmas? Just a couple of days. I want them to get to know Natalie better. Oh, because shes gonna be their, uh, stepmother. Yeah. Well, youre gonna have to ask them. I know. - How am I supposed to see my friends? - Its only for a few days. Well, duh, but thats just long enough for me to fall out of the loop. - Yeah, you cant expect us to give up our vacation. - Well, Kevin? Theres a royal family coming to visit. They have a son around your age. You might have a chance to play with a crown prince. A crown prince? Wouldnt that be cool? - Yeah, way cool. - And you guys wouldnt believe the room that Natalie has set up for you. What do you say? - I think Im gonna pass. - (exhales) It just wouldnt be right leaving the family at Christmas. Im sure you understand. Yeah. Yeah, I do. Well, its... its an open invitation, hmm? And I wont be back too late. And since youre staying home, it wouldnt hurt to do some of your chores. Yes, maam. Ill make sure they get done. Clean it, cheese-face. Ow! Oops. My fault. Hello, Im home. Hey. Howd it go? Awful. I hate Buzz and I never want to be stuck home alone with him as long as I live. Oh, honey. I know he picks on you. Picks on me? Humiliates me, tortures me. Im sick of being everyones favorite joke around here. Yeah. Yeah, its hard to be the youngest. Well, I hate Buzz. I wish I didnt have a brother or a sister. - You dont mean that. - Yes, I do! I wish I was an only child! Well, Im sorry that youre so unhappy. Maybe you should go to your room and think about what you have, rather than what you dont have. (scoffs) (sighs) Only children dont know how good they have it. Life would be perfect if Buzz and Megan werent around. I mean, is it too much to ask for a family who actually likes me? (sighs) Id run away. If I knew where to run to. Hey, I do! I have an open invitation. (coins jingling) PETER: Cant get my seat belt unfastened. (woman laughs) PETER: Thanks, Alan. Thanks. Oh, what an incredible evening. And not a bad nights work. We raised over two million for those childrens charities. Door, open. And I am on the verge of signing two of the biggest clients in Chicago. Thats because youre the best publicist in the world. - Doors, close. - Have I remembered to thank you for telling everyone that? Fire, light. Not tonight you havent. Perhaps I ought to show my appreciation. Music, on. (classical music starts) Curtains, close. (chuckles) Aw, nuts. Just when things were getting good. Nice house, huh, pumpkin? Sure is, Marv. You sure you dont wanna rob it? No. No, I dont wanna rob it. My robbery days are over. Darling, were moving up to the big money. All right? The easy money. No middleman. Pure profit. Strictly a class operation, huh? Three words, Vera. Kid... na... pping. I think thats only one word. Were gonna wait for the royals to arrive... Hup, dup, dodey-do... and then were gonna kidnap the prince. (high-pitched voice) \"Oh, dont kidnap me. Im fancy.\" You sure we can pull it off? I mean, without Harry making the plans? Look where Harrys plans kept landing me, huh? In jail. Well, not this time. Because this time... Im the boss. - (scoffs) - Whos the boss? - Youre the boss. - I love being married. Eh? - Thats my girl. - Hey! Oh! Looks like they got a visitor. This where you want to go? Yeah, this is the place. Thank you very much. (coins jingling) Keep the change. Its  all  change. (snoring) (beep) (sighs) Who are you? (gulps) MAN (on speaker):  Beg your pardon, maam. Yes, Prescott? Mr. McCallister has a visitor. The young man claims to be his son. Well, send him in. - Kevin! - Dad! Hey! Oh! I thought you said werent coming. Well, I started thinking, hey, its not fair if Mom gets all the kids for Christmas. (chuckling) Whats Christmas without kids, right? Right. Hello, Kevin. Hi, Natalie. I hope you dont mind me just dropping in like this, But my dad did invite me. - Yes, I know. - So is the invitation still open? Of course it is. Molly, would you come here, please? Ive been looking forward to spending time with you. Your dad talks about you kids a lot. Buzz is the troublemaker. Im the adorable one. Oh. Ah, Molly. This is Kevin McCallister, and hes going to be staying with us for a few days. Would you make up the special guest room? Ah, the special guest room. Right away, maam. - Oh, and Prescott, give Kevin a house key. - If you say so, ma am. What kind of key is this? Its a key to the whole house. This is a smart house, Kevin. It does whatever you tell it to. Fire, out. Curtains, open. Wow! I think Im gonna like it here. Go ahead. You try. Door, open. Wow! This stuff is so cool. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! This is such cool stuff! Ah! Oh! Look at this game! This chairs a remote control chair! Oh! Oh, yeah! This is so cool! Oh! - Think youll be comfortable here? - Ill say! Thanks, Natalie. This is gonna be the best Christmas ever! Lights out, Kev. Hey, Kevin? Kevin. How many times can I lose this child? Kevin. (cell phone rings) Hello. PETER: Kate, I... wanted to let you know Kevin just got here. Oh, thank God... He got there... safely. - I was gonna call you, but uh... - Are you okay? Yeah. Yes, Im fine. Well, thanks for letting him come. - Well, thanks for calling. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. MOLLYS VOICE:  Good mornin, Kevin. Good morning. Whos there?  Over here, dear. Hey. Hi. Breakfast time. Anything special youd like? Anything? Anything. - Wow! - Sometimes I cant wait for Santa to come, so I end up doing some shopping by myself. Would you like to open one? No, youre gonna spoil him. Dad, its her house. If she wants to spoil me, she can spoil me. All right. All right. But just one. And not... The biggest one. Does it really fly? It really does, but only outside. NATALIE: We dont want to break anything. Wow! Thanks, Natalie! Why do you have to leave? Its so close to Christmas. Yeah, I know, but the royal familys coming for one of Natalies fund-raisers, and its my job to make sure the events well-covered by press and photographers. Hey, its not gonna take that long, and I wont have to work for the rest of your vacation, okay? And if you need anything, ask Prescott. Hell take care of you. Its a cool plane, huh? I think shes trying to buy my affection. - (chuckles) Kevin. - What? Im not saying its a bad thing. Im glad youre here. (engine starts) Mr. Prescott, can I ask you a question? - Yes. - Can you make a milk shake? Do you have chocolate? What? Natalie said anything I need. And you need a milk shake, do you? A chocolate one. - Do you think well have a white Christmas? - It seems highly unlikely, given the recent unseasonable temperatures. Whats this thing? A mini elevator? Its called a dumbwaiter. - Why is it called a waiter? - Because it carries food. - Why is it called dumb? - Because it doesnt speak... or ask countless idiotic questions. (machine whirring) - Can you read? - (gasps) The door. \"No entry.\" - What, does that mean me? - Especially you. This is the control center from which I manage this entire household... as well as my personal quarters. Now, Miss Natalie may have granted you run of her home, but this is my domain and strictly off-limits. Understood? Any more questions? Good. (humming) Hey, Molly. Whatcha doing? Cleanin the house. - Gross. - Oh, no, no. Not in this house. Watch. Vacuum, on. - Vacuum, off. - Wow! The place even cleans itself! Want to see somethin really cool? Open sesame. Wow! This place is awesome. (chuckles) Yes, it is. Wow, I feel good   (lip-synching) I knew that I would now I feel good I knew that I would now So good so good I got you Ow I feel nice Like sugar and spice I feel nice Like sugar and spice So nice so nice I got you (thud) (Prescott groans) When I hold you in my arms I know that I can do no wrong And when I hold you in my arms My love wont do you no harm And I feel nice Like sugar and spice   Music, off? I feel nice Like sugar and spice   Music, off. Im off to the store. Ill be back in an hour or so. And dont pick on that dear child. Door, open. MARV: Shes out of the house. All right. The coast is clear. Lets go. Wait. Are you sure its safe? Pumpkin, would I take you in there if it wasnt safe? Its just if the prince dont arrive till tomorrow, why are we going in there now? To get the lay of the land. What do ya think, Vera, Were just gonna go in there tomorrow and start grabbing kids? \"Ooh, everybody get in the van.\" No. We gotta figure out the where, the when, the how to get him out of there. Do you know the secret to criminal success? Not getting caught. Planning. Preparation. Preparedness. Be prepared. Be a prepared \"preperator.\" Eh? Thats my motto, and thats why Im... A boy scout. No. The boss, eh? Whos the boss? Youre the boss! Wheres the boss? Right here. Hey. Boss, party of one. Right there. All right. Lets go, pookie. No. It cant be! It is! Its Marv! Mr. Prescott? Mr. Prescott, are you there? Mr. Prescott! Help! (gasps) Marv, the alarm is on. Oh, no. What are we gonna do? Watch this, eh? Oh. - Alarm, off. - (beeps) Hmm. Door, open. (buzz) Ahh! That is one handy gadget. Well, whats my motto? Youre the boss? Be prepared. Yeah. Right. I married a genius. What do you think that is? Is that a turkey ball? Just put that down. Like a klepto here. All right. - The prince should be staying in one of these rooms. - I think thats an elevator. Dont... you give me such a headache. You give me a headache. Youre giving me a headache. You give me a headache. - MARV: Dont push me. - Door, close. (whispering) Youre driving me crazy. Youre driving me crazy. Youre driving me... Oh, shut up. Door, open. Door, close. I love this thing. Marv... The door was... shutting. Whats wrong with this thing? Door, open. MARV (whispering): I think theres somebody here. Anybody in here? Well, not now. Shh! You shh! You shh! You shh! (water running) Maybe the prince came early. (water running) (raspberry) MARV: What the... (both screaming) (groans) Thats it. Come on. (groans) Ow! (groaning) (screaming) (water rushing) (gasping) Up! - MARV: Come on, honey. - Uh! Marv! - (creaking) - (Vera gasping) (screaming) MARV: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay! (Vera gasping) Mr. Prescott! Mr. Prescott! - You! - Hello, Marv. Well, long time, no see. - Huh, kid? - Is that the prince? No, thats Kevin. Kevin, Vera. Vera, Kevin. If that aint him, lets get outta here before somebody sees us. Yeah. I think we got the lay of the land. Ill be back! (yells) Come on! Oh, all right! (tires squealing) House, clean yourself up. (buzzes) Well, it was worth a try. Okay, maybe they wont be too mad. I mean, once I tell them what happened, maybe theyll be okay with it. (screams) Or maybe not. What... what... What... what... (creaking) What... what... Okay, I know it looks bad, but... (screams) Honey, whats the... (panting) Kevin, what... what... What have you done? Prescott! Prescott! Its not working. I tried. Prescott:  Yes, maam? Get up here! Now! - Well, it wasnt working. - Kevin, what happened? It wasnt me. It was the burglars. - The burglars? - Yeah. And I recognized the one guy. Marv. Did I ever tell you about him? Well, thats another story. But the point is they were gonna rip off your house. - So you chose instead to trash it? - No. I was trying to protect it. - By trashing it? - What in the name of... Hey, why didnt you come when I was calling you? Prescott, Were you aware of any burglars here today? Burglars? No, maam. All the alarms were on as usual. Maybe they turned em off. They had one of these, you know. I saw no intruders, and except for... beg your pardon, maam... The briefest of bathroom breaks, my eyes were on the monitors at all times. How one child could do so much damage in the time it took me to... - Well, its quite beyond me. - It wasnt me! Well, there was no one else here. - Hes lying! - Am not! - Are too! - Am not! - Are too! - With all due respect, sir, I did see master Kevin playing with the devices... as if the house were a big toy. (gasps) The only hooligan here today was your son. (hyperventilating) Give us a minute. (hyperventilating continues) Kevin. (hyperventilating continues) Kevin, sit. Dad... Whats going on? I told you. The burglars broke into the house. Kevin, you know I can forgive just about anything but lying. Oh, right. So you wouldnt get mad if I wrecked the place, which I didnt, as long as I admit that I did, which I didnt? Well, I thought this over and, uh, I understand that this is a difficult adjustment for you. And its only natural that youd be acting out. Its a need for attention. - No, it isnt. - Kevin! Anyway... Anyway, whats a little damage? Its not as if Im not insured. Do you have something to say? Thank you. - And? - Im sorry for the damage of your house. (audio rewinding) The security cameras must have got the whole thing on tape. What? Prescott must have turned off the cameras. MARV: Its unbelievable. It is not to be believed! I cant believe this! Its the lousy kid again. Everywhere I break into! Its like hes stalking me or something. Come on, Marv. Hes just a little boy. Yeah, well, I got big scars from that little... Never mind. Ill tell you one thing, this time hes not gonna mess me up. - Mm-hmm. - This time its all gonna go smooth as silk. Because this time... I got an inside man. - (chuckling) - (chuckling) Oh. (chuckles) (grunts) (tires squeal) Hey, hey, hey, hey! (horn honking) MARV: Hey, come on! Watch the road! Safety first. - (screams) - What are you doing here? - Tell me. - I, uh... I... Nothing. I swear. I just thought all of this was kinda cool so I wanted to take a look at it. You dont go to other peoples homes uninvited, and you dont touch their things. Didnt I warn you what would happen if I ever caught you in here again? Not specifically. Trust me. It wont be pleasant. (knocking on door) What do you want? I thought I heard the boy. Ah! And indeed I did. I dont want him bothering you anymore, so Ill just get him out of your way. Come along, Kevin. Hell be my responsibility from now on. Thank you for saving me, Molly. Prescott is a good person to stay away from. Youre telling me. Hes one of the bad guys... The bad guys who broke into the house. Although technically they didnt break in, because they had their own remote. And who do you think gave them that? Prescott? - Mm-hmm. - That sounds a bit far-fetched to me. I know. And you probably think I have an overactive imagination. Most people do. But you have to believe me. Kevin, Prescott is a lonely man. The only thing he has is this job. And between you and me, he hates working here. But to do what youre suggesting... Then it all makes perfect sense. He hates his job, so he tries to pull off a big heist so he can afford to quit. Ah, I dont know. Listen. He told my dad I was lying when I wasnt. And he shut off the security cameras. So it can only mean one thing. - And that is? - Marv and his new friend... have an inside guy... Prescott. I think youre right. - I am? - Yeah. You do have an overactive imagination. But thats what I love about children. My own son was the same as you at your age... a real handful. You must have been a great mom, Molly. Well, you just try to keep that imagination under control, okay? (classical music on stereo) PETER: You were very understanding about what happened today. Well, Kevins going through a difficult time. Its not easy when your parents split up. Believe me, I know. But well get through it. Youre gonna be a great stepmom. (music continues) (exhales) I think we just need to figure out a way to make him feel more at home here. Maybe do some of the Christmas things hes used to doing, like trimming the tree. You do that yourself? (chuckles) Yes, I do that myself. Its fun. Thats exactly what were gonna do. Were gonna trim the tree. Itll get us in the spirit of things, unite us as a family. Okay. Okay? No friends, no fun, no snow. This is definitely gonna be the worst Christmas ever. Hey, Kev. How you doing? (sighs) What do you say we just forget about today and start over, huh? You mean it? Yeah. You know, Natalies really a great person. You just gotta get to know her better. I think we should start having a little more fun around here. I could live with that. Yeah? Why dont we start by trimming that tree? Now? Sure. Why not? Jingle bells jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh Jingle bells jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh Over the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bobtails ring making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight Oh, jingle bells jingle bells Jingle all the way oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh Jingle bells jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh (phone rings) Dashing through the snow   (ringing continues) In a one-horse open sleigh Over the fields we go - Hello.  -   Laughing all the way - Hold on, I cant hear you. Can you turn down the music?  -   Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight   Music, off. What did you say? Of course well be there. We wouldnt miss it. Let me call you back. (phone beeps off) Evangelistas in town. Margarets just throwing together a little impromptu supper, but we shouldnt go, should we? Well, why dont you just go ahead without me, and Kevin and I will finish up over here? Really? You wouldnt mind? No. Theyre your friends anyway. Youre an angel. I wont be home late. Okay. Where were we? You dont have to stay because of me. No, I want to stay. Really. So, does Natalie go out every night? Pretty much. She leads a very exciting life... more exciting than were used to. So youd say youre not in a rut? No, Im not in a rut. Why? I thought maybe thats why you left. Kevin. Kevin, you know... I didnt leave your mom to be with Natalie, okay? That just kind of happened later. You wanna tell me about it? (exhales) Adult relationships are just complicated. Sometimes when two people get married really young like your mom and I did, You just end up feeling kind of... - You missed out on some things. - Yeah. Just cause you grow up on the outside, doesnt mean you wanna stop having fun, enjoying life. I know all about the inner child, Dad. - Oh. You do, huh? - Thats why old guys drive sports cars. Youre probably right. But the trouble with sports cars... no room for anybody else. Maybe one other person max. But if you want to take a real road trip, with luggage and all, you dont even have room for a friend. I mean, theyre cool and fast and all, but who wants to be in a nice car when youre all alone? (Kate sighs) Well, that looks just about perfect. All thats left to do now is put on the star. Kevin always puts on the star. Thats right. He does, doesnt he? I always hold him up. And then I give him a wedgie. (chuckles) He makes a fuss. We all laugh. Well, I guess were just gonna have to use the ladder this year. Okay, Dad, you can put me down now. Wow. Looks pretty good. I think it looks great. I think its our best tree yet. PETER (on tv):  Hey! (family chattering) - Merry Christmas, Mommy.  - KEVIN:  Merry Christmas. KATE (on tv):  Merry Christmas. (all chattering) Oh! Look at that! KATE:  Hey. Hey.  PETER:  Hey. PETER:  I had this little computer chip installed in Mom. Were gonna get her to make some breakfast. (yawns) Morning. Mornin. Good morning, sleepyheads. Youre finally up. What did you do to our tree? Oh, thats my fault. I have a standing appointment with the tree decorators every year. And in all the excitement, I forgot to cancel. Are you ever gonna forgive me? You undid our tree? Well, it would have had to come down eventually anyway. Yeah, come on, Kev. Look at all these presents, huh? Oh, wait. Ooh, heres a big one. I believe it has... Yes, it has your name on it. Come on. Lets open it up. Its from Natalie and me. But shouldnt I open it tomorrow on Christmas? Ah, you got plenty to open tomorrow. Come on. One wont hurt. Go ahead. (gasps) Super spy bugging and listening device. Isnt that cool? Yeah. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Natalie. Im glad you like it. - Hey, Mom, where are you going? - Im going to take Kevin some things. - Mom, where you going? - He doesnt have any clean clothes with him, and Im sure he doesnt have any toys to play with. To check out Dads girlfriend. Wanna go? (doorbell rings) May I help you? Wow! Im here for Kevin McCallister. Wow! Buzz. - Are you here to take him home? - No, I have something for him. Right this way. PETER: You should be able to hear that. How do I sound? KATE (on headset):  Kids, stay close. Mom! Hey! Hey! Mmm! Ohh! - (chuckles) - Hey, you guys remember Natalie, right? Buzz, Megan. Hi, Natalie. Oh, and, uh, Kate, this is Natalie. Natalie, Kate. Hello, Kate. Hello. So, are you guys gonna stay? No, I just brought you some of your stuff. You guys gotta see this house. - Is that okay, Natalie? - Of course. Be my guest. Awesome tree! It used to look better. Wait, what is this thing on your head? Its a spy kit that Natalie got me for an early Christmas present. Really? That was nice of you. Well, Im very fond of your kids. Ive gotta show you this airplane that she got me. Would you like a cup of coffee? Oh, no, thank you. I, uh, didnt know he would have all this stuff to play with. Yeah. Oh, god. Hey. Let me get that. I wasnt even sure he could even sleep without it. Gosh, you know what? I cannot believe he hasnt even asked for it. Well, we could buy him another stuffed animal. Oh, no, no. No. This is, uh, is Teddy. Teddy is his transitional object. Yeah. Transitional object. Its like something very, very special a child carries with him everywhere. Youre actually supposed to have a spare, in case something happens to it. Of course, we only had one, remember? Oh! How could I forget? We were driving down the highway, like, really in a hurry, going somewhere, of course, Kevin thinks, oh possibly Teddy might want a little fresh air. So he rolls down the window and out flies Teddy! He was ballistic. He was crying. He was so upset. It was... oh, my... So Peter pulls over, and I get out to retrieve the bear. - I still cant believe you did that. - (chuckles) Well, it was the slow lane, and there wasnt much traffic. Yeah, well, I dont know what he would have done if he had lost it. Well, I think Kevins going to have so much fun playing with the prince... that hes not even gonna miss the stuffed animal. Its going to be so wonderful having a house full of children. Im looking forward to it. Children, watch the garden sculpture! Well, I... better get going. Before they break something. Well, were off to the airport to pick up the royal family. You all know how important this is. Now, the caterers will be here momentarily. And the guests will arrive about an hour before... you and the royals make your grand entrance. MOLLY: No need to worry, maam. Everything will be taken care of. Its just that I want everything to go right. Come on. Lets not be late. I dont want one single thing to go wrong. Door, open. And nothing will. (people chattering) (knocking on door) Prescott: Oh, good. Youve finally arrived. - Mr. Prescott! Mr. Prescott! Its them! - Hush, you. Ill get him out of your way. Thank you. Its the burglars! Its the burglars! Aah! Mr. Prescott! KEVIN (yelling): its Marv! I guess you already knew that though. Listen, you. I have just about had enough of you and your melodrama! This is a very important night, and if I have to lock you up to keep you out of our way, dont think I wont do it. Look! Ow! Ow! Ow! Dont trifle with me, you demon spawn! Now thats a foolish place to hide. (groans) One down, two to go. (muffled) Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Its freezing cold! Let me out! Kevin, have you seen Prescott? Not lately. Ah, typical. Always poking around when you dont want him, and when you need him... nowhere to be found. (doorbell rings) Ah! Guests already? Whatever happened to fashionably late? NATALIE: Well, I dont like to boast, but, yes, it will be the party of the season. (beep) Oh, Im getting another call. All right. See you there. Hello? Carmelina, how are you? (mouthing words) What? Oh, no! Theyre snowed in. Their flights been canceled. Well, so am I. Devastated. Well, all right. Well see you tomorrow. Merry Christmas. (phone beeps off) What are we gonna do now? Its gonna be just an ordinary party. Christmas Eve at your place sounds anything but ordinary to me. Its hardly the party of the season. Peter. - What if we announce our engagement tonight? - Tonight? I know we were gonna wait till after your divorce was final, but its only a few weeks away and your kids already know, and itll make tonight so special. Well, if it makes you happy. Yes! (chuckles) Where are those guys? Marv, I gotta tinkle. Vera, you can tinkle next week. MARV (on headset):  Always in a hurry. Door, open. All right. Now, you remember the plan? Which plan? Harrys plan? What... no! Not harrys plan! The one involving rope and a bag! Why are you yelling at me? Im not yell... Do you remember the plan? Yeah. Now, when the prince comes up to bed... We bag him! - Thats right. We kidnap the kid napping. - Youre a genius, Marv. Thats right. Door, open. Now, the prince goes in the bag. The bag goes out the window. Uh-huh. We climb down the rope.  Door, close. Right. MARV (on headset):  Everybody in the van. And were gone before they know what hit em. Beautiful plan, Marv. Elegant in its simplicity. All right. Lets try it out. Get in the bag. Me? Why dont you get in the bag? Because Im the boss. Get in the bag, Vera. - I dont wanna get in the bag. - Vera, just get in the bag! Please! You didnt tell me I was gonna get in no bag. I was saving it. Its gonna be fun. Ooh, were in the bag! - (grunting) - (groaning) Nice. All right. Window, open. Ahh. (grunts) VERA: Uh, Marv. Ooh. Oh. (grunts) Dont worry, honey. I got ya. Marv! Let me down easy. I always do, baby. (straining) Shouldnt have had that last piece of cake. (yelps) (rope creaking) - Perfect. - Door, open. (screams) - (groans) - Dont worry. Everythings under control. Uh, uh, Marv... (screaming) - (thud) - Easy... but still way cool. (Marv groaning) Thanks for breaking my fall, pumpkin. (hoarse voice) I always do, baby. Okay. Get out and stay out! - I know what youre trying to do. - Oh, yeah, wise guy? What? Youre trying to kidnap the prince. Shut up, ya little moron! - Im gonna kill him. - Okay. (chuckling) (raspberry) Vera, honey. Little help? Oh, yeah, baby. Thatd be great. I sure could use it. -  (Marv groaning on headset)  - I got every word. (imitates cheer) (classical music on stereo) Welcome back. Wheres the royal family? They were snowed in. Ah! Wheres Prescott? I cant find him anywhere. Thats odd. Well, Molly, make sure everyone has champagne. Were going to make a special announcement. Yes, maam. How are you? Hi, how are you? Good to see you again. Everyone, may I have your attention? Huh? I am gonna kill that... Uuh! - (clattering) - (screaming) This is always a special night, and tonight may be even more special. (seething) Get him! - Peter and I are engaged! - (crowd exclaiming) (screams, shouts) - (teeth chattering) - Prescott? - (softly moaning) - This could not be goin worse. Marv, youre on fire. Oh, thanks, baby. Youre not so bad yourself. No, sweetheart. Youre really on fire. Well, I try to work out. You know... Aah! Gaah! Aah! - Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! - Kevin! Im not lying. The bad guys are back. Were not getting anywhere. Kevin, I spoke to all the caterers and to Molly. Nobody saw a thing but you. Now, how could that be? I dont know. But I heard theyre gonna kidnap the prince. - You heard them say that? - Yeah, with my super spy bugging device. - And Prescotts involved with the whole thing. - This is absurd. Im going to call and make sure the royal familys flight is okay for tomorrow. Kevin, I know whats going on here. You do? Yeah. Youre out to destroy my relationship with Natalie. What? You knew how important tonight was to her, and you went and pulled a crazy stunt like this. - Thats not the truth. - Ive given you a lot of leeway, because I know how tough this divorce has been on you. But tonight you went way too far. I want you to go to your room and think about what youve done. And when youre ready to apologize to Natalie, then well talk. Door, close. Here you are, George! Merry Christmas!  (woman crying) (ringing) - Hello? - Mom? Kevin! Oh, Kevin. Im so glad you called. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Im just watching  Its a Wonderful Life. - You are? - You know how that gets to me. - What channel is it on? - Eight. Ohh. I guess Im just a sucker for happy endings. So, how is your party? Are you havin a good time? Yeah, its all right. How about you? Havin a good Christmas Eve? Yeah. Its great. (sniffles) - (sobs) I love you, Kevin. - Love you too, Mom. (laughs) Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Okay. Bye. (beeps off) (beeps off) (crying) (knocking) - Kevin, are you awake? - Yeah. Your father and I were a little rough on you before. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Good. Because if you ever do anything like that again, youll be out of this house so fast... your head will spin. So your fathers getting divorced. Boo-hoo. Everyones parents get divorced. Thats life. Youll get over it. But youre not gonna come between your father and me. He wants you in his life, and I think thats admirable. But if you want him in your life, you better not cross me. Understood? Good. Ill have that window fixed first thing in the morning. Sweet dreams. MAN (on tv):  To my big brother George, the richest man in town. (crowd exclaiming) Ive just had a nice little chat with Kevin. I think were beginning to understand each other better. What are you watching? Its a Wonderful Life.  Theyve been running it all night. - Come on. Watch it with me. - Ive seen it. - So? - So... I dont understand people who watch movies over and over again. I saw it. I cried. Once was enough. You gotta be kidding. Kate and I watch this every year with the kids. Its a family tradition. Well. (clicks off) Now that youre going to have a new family, maybe its time for some new traditions. Theyll be back. And if no one believes me, Ill have to catch em myself. (grunts) MARV:  Shut up, you little moron. (clicks off) (keyboard clacking) Shut up, you moron. - Okay, stop. - (beeps) (electronic voice)  Spin faster. (keyboard clacking) MARV:  Get in the bag. Shut up, ya bag! Christmas morning. Merry Christmas, Kevin. Merry Christmas, Dad! Hey, hey! - Peter, are you ready to go? - Go? Go where? Kevin, Natalie and I gotta go pick up the royal family right now. Now? But arent we gonna open presents? Its gonna have to wait till we get back. But its Christmas. And why do you both have to go? Look, you know how sometimes you gotta do things you dont wanna do? This is one of those times. Hey, well be back before you know it, okay? And Im sure nothing will happen while were gone. Am I right? - Right. - Good. Hang in there. We wont be long. Door, open. (door opens) NATALIE: Merry Christmas, Kevin. (door shuts) Merry Christmas. (cell phone rings) (ringing continues) - (sighs) - (beeps on) Hello? No, were awake. It wasnt me! Shh! All right. Were on our way. (beeps off) Oy. Sure makes me nervous. Lets go, pookie. I knew it. Here they come. First step... eliminate the inside man. Oh, Mr. Prescott? Mr. Prescott, are you in there? (pounding) Yes. Mr. Prescott, can you help me with something? And what would that be? Another milk shake, perhaps? No. A bottle of wine. Excuse me? Natalie said we need to get some wine from the basement... for the royal family. If we must. So I guess youre right. Were not gonna have any snow this Christmas. One can never go wrong with low expectations. You know, Mr. Prescott, its been great spending time with you these last few days. Time flies when youre having fun. I know we got off to a bad start, but things can be better... much better. - Cause youre down there, and Im up here. - Come get... (pounding) Young man, open this door! Let me out of here! Oh! Oh, boy! Am I glad to see you! The kidnappers are coming. But this time Im one step ahead of them. And I locked their accomplice in the basement. Is this a perfect plan, or what? It would be, dear, except for one thing... Prescott is not their accomplice. I am. (gasps) Youre... youre the inside man? - Im afraid so. - Hey, Mom. Were here. Oh, yeah, yeah. - Mom? Hes your son? - I told you he was a handful. Aah! Hey! Get off of me! Oh, now, come on! Isnt there a trapdoor or something? No. Not much demand for em in a wine cellar. Guess youre right. Got any good ideas? Not a one. (sighs) I do have a cell phone though. Perfect! May I? Sure. Thanks. (beeping) (ringing, beeps on) Hello, Buzz? Kevin, is that you? - Yeah. Im calling from a cell phone. - Oh, a cell phone. Good for you, puke-face. Is that another present she gave you? What a showoff. (beeps off) - Ill try again. - (keypad beeping) (ringing, beeps on) Buzz, before you hang up, I need to tell you something. I need to talk to Mom. Okay. You told me. (beeps off) (beeps off) Ill try again later. (sighs) Why in heavens name did you think I was the inside man? Well, if you hadnt acted so strange, I wouldnt have thought you were... so strange. And where were you the first time these guys broke in? Why didnt you answer the intercom? Why did you shut off the cameras? I didnt. But if those thugs were using Mollys remote, they couldve turned off the whole security system. - But whyd you say I was lying? - Well, because I thought you were. And besides, I didnt want Miss Natalie to know that Id been, well, napping on the job. That woman. If she could work me 24 hours a day, she would. Its downright inhuman. So, whenever shes not here, I, uh... You take advantage. I take a break. A nice, well-deserved break. With all the cameras and intercoms turned off, I didnt notice anything. - So I... - You were covering your whoo-hoo! (chuckles) Precisely. You want to try calling your mom again? Sure. (ringing) - Hello? - Mom? Kevin! (static) - Wait. Kevin, I cant hear you. - Thats probably cause Im locked in a wine cellar. No, I... honey, I cant hear you. Theres too much static. (yelling) Im locked in Natalies wine cellar! - Are you calling to say Merry Christmas? - Mom, are you there? - Sweetheart? - Are you there, Mom? - Kevin? - Mom? Mom? (beeps off) Oh, great! The batterys dead. (sighs) Hmm. (ringing) - (beeps on) - Kalban residence. Hi, this is Kate McCallister, Kevins mom. May I speak to him, please? Kevins not here right now. Thats strange. He just called. Really? Well, hes out with his father and Miss Natalie. Oh. Oh, he must have called from his dads cell phone. That explains the line going dead. Okay. Thank you. (clicks, dial tone) (beeps off) Little rascal called his mother. You want me to go show him whos boss? Sit down, Marv. Youre not the boss. Im the boss. Okay. (mouthing words) His cell phone is dead. I dont think hell be any more trouble. No. Cookie. - (cell phone rings) - Oh! - (beeps on) - Hello? Peter, its me. Im calling Kevin back. We got disconnected. Kevin? Kevins not with me. Hes back at Natalies house. Really? I was just told hes with you. Well... well, dont worry, Kate. Im sure everythings fine. Okay. - Wow, thats weird. - (phone beeps off) - Someone told Kate that Kevins with us. - Hmm. Maybe I better go back and check on him. No. Thats exactly what he wants. Peter, hes manipulating you. Cant you see the pattern? Every time we leave the house, he pulls something. Hes just trying to get your attention and sabotage me. Hello! Anybody out there? Hello! Theres gotta be something that we can do to get outta here. There is. Help me move these boxes. Okay. But whats back there? Definitely not a \"dumb\" question. The dumbwaiter! Bingo. - Lets hope it still works. - Im sorry I misjudged you, Mr. Prescott. Likewise. Ill never forget Miss Natalies reaction... when she came home and saw what youd done to the house. - (rapid panting) - (wheezing, laughing) I do love watching her hyperventilate! (laughs) Its one of the few pleasures of this job. If you hate this job, why dont you quit? Jobs arent that easy to come by. Besides, I could end up working for someone far worse. You shouldnt stay someplace you hate just cause youre scared. Lifes too short. Hmm. And voila. Lets see if you fit. Mm, up. Watch your head. As soon as I get up, Im gonna let you out. You just take care of yourself, you hear? (switch clicks, whirring) MARV: Im tellin ya, I heard something. All right. Stay very alert here, Vera. I tell you what. Why dont you go down, check out the wine cellar? Okay. Yeah. There you go. KEVIN: Down here! You better stay... Oww! Vera! Ow! Aah! Vera! What? Ooh! Hit the button! - Hang on, baby! Huuh! - Oh! No, no! Hit the button! What? I cant hear you. Hit the button! - Oh! - Oww! No, no! Not that one! The other button! Thats it! Oww! Hey! Man! Over here! - (groaning) - (Kevin laughing ) - Hi, Mommy. - (gasps) - Yes! - (clicking buttons) See ya. Door, open! (grinding) Natalie, you go get the royals. Im gonna go back and check on Kevin. - What, now? - Yeah, somethins up. I can sense it. - Maybe you have to be a parent. - Thats not fair. You know how much I care about kids. How much do you care about my kid? Taxi! Kevin? Are you all right? (grunting) (horn honking) Mom, do you think you could slow down a little bit? Kevins probably fine. You just keep an eye out for cops, okay? All right, Vera. Go check out the living room. See if hes in there, all right? God! I cant believe this. I shoulda gone to college. Two years, coulda been a dental technician. Two years! Marv! Hes in the bedroom! - Mom? - Get him! Door, open. Got ya. Uuh! Gaah! Aah! Ooh! Door, close. - Hey, Molly! - Get in there! - Marv, honey. You in there? - (beeps) Shut up, Vera! Well, okay. I was just tryin to... - Shut up, you moron.  - Hey, Im no moron, you jerk. - Shut up, ya bag!  - Door, open! - Whats wrong with you? - Whats wrong with you? Im no bag. And you know what? You aint no genius! Vera, honey... No! Dont \"Vera, honey\" me! Youre not even as smart as this kid, who, in case you hadnt noticed... is totally kickin our butts! Well, from now on, I am my own boss! Vera. Vera, honey... Dont \"honey\" me! Pumpkin. Pumpkin. Marv! Forget about her! Get the kid! Ill be outta here in a few minutes. (buzzing) (thuds, buzzing stops) Oh! (chuckling) Whoa! (yelping) (both groaning) Hey! Hey! Open sesame. Well, get a load of that. Holy majolie! Come on, Vera! All right! Come on out, kid! Ah! All right. Open bar. Open bookshelf. (buzzes) Open... open book-bar. Open book-bar-shelf. Open... open book-bar-thing. Open sesame. Thats stupid. Whoa! Whos stupid now, stupid? Hey, come on. Just get off me, all right? MARV: Im gonna take care of everything. Bar, revolve sesame. MARV: Watch this. Its all gonna be fine. Bar, stop. Oh! Its goin faster! Yeah, I know, Vera. I know its goin faster. - Speed faster sesame. - Okay. The wifes not feelin... Faster sesame! - (panicked yelling) - Maximum speed sesame. (Kevin laughing) Stop sesame. (gasps) (screaming) Nice jump, Marv. (groaning) Ohh! (gasping) Oof! Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. Good night. Aah! (Kevin gasps) - Mr. Prescott! - At your service. - Boy, am I glad to see you. - (chuckles) Perhaps we should call the police. Good idea, Mr. Prescott. Just \"Prescott\" to you. \"Prescott!\" I thought you said you werent worried. I dont know. I just had a feeling. - (Marv, Vera gasping) - PETER: Kevin! Dad! Mom! Mom? - Who are they? - Uh-oh! Lets get outta here! Around the back! Were on it. Lets go! Kevin! Ooh-ooh! Yes! Uuh! Yeah! Way to go, guys! KATE: Kevin! - Kevin! - Mom! Oh, honey! Im so glad youre all right. Ohh! I am now! Im so sorry I didnt believe you. - Mmm! - (Prescott clears throat) The police have been summoned. Ive got lots of fun planned for your stay. Can we go to Wrigley Field? And the aquarium? Do you have any kids? No. But I promise well have a very exciting time. - (sirens wailing) - Cool! Oh, come on. No, prisons not so bad. Oh, yeah? Yeah. On Thursdays you get Salisbury steak. Yeah, I know about prison. Thats where I met you. Calm down. Calm down. You calm down. Women, eh? Yeah. Hey, dont touch me. - Peter! Whats he done now? - Well, he saved the day, thats what. You should be thanking him. Molly? What in the world is going on? It seems they were gonna kidnap the prince. Best we can gather, shes the boss. Shes my maid. Im her boss! Well, looks like youre gonna have to find a new maid. And a new butler, Im afraid. - I resign. - Resign? But... why? Because as a wise young man once said, \"Lifes too short.\" Peter, do something. All right. Here goes. Natalie, I think I mistook... infatuation and excitement for love. Look, this... this is your world. Its not mine. The whole time I was here, all I did was miss my family. Im in love with my wife and kids, and I belong with them. And I wanna come home. I mean, I understand if you need time to think about it. Mom? Oh! (crying) I love you. I love you. Young man, how are we ever going to show you our gratitude? Would your family like to spend Christmas with our family? That sounds cool. - Is that okay? - (chuckles) Yes. Youre going to be with them? Today? On Christmas? (crying) (panting) Thank you. Music, on. (Christmas music playing) Snow, fall. Ha ha! Hey! I knew this was gonna be the best Christmas ever!
